# Kaindex

Full-stack web application to access Kaindex database.

## About

This full-stack web application shows all data of the private Kaindex database, which is currently not available to the public due to privacy reasons.
If you're an authenticated user, you can [Log in to Kaindex](https://kaindex.laurensk.at) using your user credentials.

## Frontend/Backend

This project uses Node as backend with React on the frontend side. We use a special Express middleware to securely block API access outside the local infrastructure.
